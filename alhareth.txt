The solution to ensure live data updates across the application was to force dynamic rendering for the Archive, Theses, Reserved Titles, and Dashboard pages. This was achieved by adding the line `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to the `page.tsx` file in each of these directories. This configuration setting instructs Next.js to bypass static generation and always render the page on the server for each request, ensuring that the latest data is fetched and displayed.
